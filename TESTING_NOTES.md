- Since I don't use a ton of due dates in my notes, the task load calendar doesn't seem all that useful. There also appear to be some visual glitches with text running over date cards.

- Review radar is excellent, let's expand on that.

- Bug fix that was causing crashing seems to work, moving a note around just updates the visualization in real time now. 
- Noticed that no history of where the note has been throughout the PARA system appears in that visualization, that metadata might not be tracked properly. 
- I'd love some additional visualizations that compare the relative effort between projects, like the number of tasks cleared as a pie chart. It would also be helpful to surface tasks or projects that might have been forgotten so they can be assessed for importance. 
- New bug found: if you have the visualizer open and you create a new note, Obsidian crashes. 
- This might be noted elsewhere, but we should plan on adding a config screen that replicates some functionality of Quick PARA, including checking for dependencies (in this case, Visualizer depends on Quick PARA) and brief explanations of each visualization, along with a toggle to add or remove it from the visualizer panel. It would also be great to be able to re-order them from this screen if possible.
